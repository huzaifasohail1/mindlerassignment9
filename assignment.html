    <p>One person who comes to mind when thinking about someone who failed but still achieved great success in the computer science and information technology field is Steve Jobs.
<p>
Steve Jobs co-founded Apple Inc. in 1976 and went on to become one of the most iconic figures in the tech industry. However, Jobs didn't always have smooth sailing. In 1985, he was forced out of Apple, the company he had co-founded. This could have been a crushing blow for anyone, but Jobs didn't let it get him down.</p>
</p>
<p>
Instead, he used this setback as an opportunity to learn and grow. He co-founded NeXT, a computer company focused on higher education and business markets, and also purchased Pixar Animation Studios, which would eventually become a major player in the film industry.
</p>
<p>
In 1996, Apple bought NeXT and Jobs returned to the company he had co-founded. Under his leadership, Apple went on to release groundbreaking products like the iPod, iPhone, and iPad, which revolutionized the tech industry and made Apple one of the most successful and innovative companies in the world.
</p>
<p>
Jobs' story is a testament to the fact that failure is not the end, but rather a stepping stone to success. He didn't let his setbacks hold him back, and instead used them as an opportunity to learn and grow. His determination and perseverance ultimately paid off, and he achieved great success in the tech industry.</p>
